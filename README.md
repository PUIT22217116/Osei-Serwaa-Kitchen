# Osei Serwa Kitchen — Starter Project

This folder contains a starter structure for the Osei Serwa Kitchen website.

Contents (created):

- index.php, about.php, menu.php, gallery.php, contact.php, reservation.php
- admin/dashboard.php, admin/manage-menu.php, admin/manage-reservations.php, admin/admin-login.php
- includes/header.php, includes/footer.php, includes/config.php, includes/database.php, includes/functions.php, includes/auth.php
- css/ (main.css, index.css, about.css, menu.css, gallery.css, contact.css, reservation.css), css/admin/
- js/ (main.js, animations.js, form-validation.js, gallery-slider.js, menu-filter.js), js/admin/
- images/ (hero, gallery, menu, about, icons, background)
- assets/ (fonts, icons, downloads) and uploads/ (menu-items, gallery-images)

Next steps:

- Replace database credentials in `includes/config.php` and secure configuration via environment variables.
- Add real images to `images/` and `uploads/`.
- Wire up form handlers and server-side validation in `contact.php` and `reservation.php`.
- Harden `includes/auth.php` and implement proper admin authentication.

Enjoy — let me know if you want me to wire up a sample DB, add sample menu items, or scaffold an installer.
